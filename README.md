3. type: node server.js
4. open a browser and go to the URL: localhost:8888/exampleX/ Replace the X with the example

## examples

### Example1
Just a simple demo that loads a mp3 file from the server by clicking load and you than can play or stop it

### Example2
Pretty the same as Example1 but with a volume slider bar

### Example3
Added the function to Play/Pause

### Example4
Lets get fancy! My Fav Demo! It repersents the Music in a Rainbow Circle. 
Actually there are 2 Circle because we need a finer representation of the lower Freq.
It repsondes in realtime even to Volumen changen.

### Example5
This is a 10 Band Bar representation of the Music

### Example6
